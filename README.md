# Anime Royale

Deployed [here](https://romilk-senpai.github.io/anime-royale/)

Depends on [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) and [SDL2_image](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image)

Also depends on data structures from my library [rcds](https://github.com/romilk-senpai/rcds)

Primarily for web target, compiles wherever atm. Check `CMakeLists.txt` and `Makefile` for paths. Especially cmake, had to put absolute path because of WSL strange behaviour.
